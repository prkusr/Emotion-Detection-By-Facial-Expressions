* Emotion Detection - Emotion detection: We try to predict the emotion expressed by a person in the given image. Dataset: csv files containing emotions column along with pixel values of facial images (labels) . (https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detector/data).
* Handwriting Gender Prediction - Trying to predict the gender of person based on the handwriting. Another project focused with image processing.

* Please refer Cnn-copy1 and CnnOrganised for proper implementation. Others have trial and error code.
  * CnnOrganised has the data processing and saving.
  * Cnn-copy1 has the Convonet implementation using keras.
